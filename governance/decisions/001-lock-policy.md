# 001 - Agent Work Item and Lock Policy Enforced

## Context
With the proliferation of multi-agent and parallel task execution, enforcing strict `lock_paths` constraints has become essential. Agents executing parallel tasks must not overwrite each other's work or stray out of their assigned domains. We introduced an Agent Work Item template that explicitly demands listing allowed paths, the type of lock, an owner, and expiry metadata.

## Decision
We enforce the usage of the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent_work_item.yml` template for all multi-agent tasks on RIVO CONF.
Agents must read the issue `lock_paths`, stick explicitly to them, and any PRs generated by the agents must reference this Issue along with its fields. The PR description or commit message should clearly denote the lock paths to ensure the QA/Gatekeeper layers verify isolated changes efficiently. Any changes outside `lock_paths` are forbidden and should cause CI failure or PR rejection by reviewers.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Better stability during highly parallel execution tracks (e.g., TDD orchestrators running alongside backend architects).
- CI/CD can systematically verify that a branch created from an agent task issue only touches files within the granted lock paths.
- Less context collision between specialized skills (e.g., `CPQ / API` and `Quality Gates`).
