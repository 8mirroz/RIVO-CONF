# UI/3D Guidelines

## Required Screens
Reverse mode: requirements, solutions, details, export, save/share.
Guided mode: product type, geometry, load, mounting, modules, validation, summary, order/export.

## Mandatory Feedback Elements
- Validation status badge.
- Why unavailable tooltip.
- Suggested fix action.
- Price and lead-time recalculation indicator.

## Viewer Boundary
- Accept only validated snapshot input.
- Never evaluate constraints in viewer runtime.
- Keep camera and visual state independent from business logic.
